# Superpixeling

The repository contains Python scripts implementing the superpixel-based 2D image analysis algoritms.
This includes:

* extraction of image descriptors based on histograms of superpixel features
* extraction of image descriptors based on co-occurrence matrices of superpixel classes
* highlighting key regions on the images which differentiate images of two classes
